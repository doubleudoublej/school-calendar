# React App Setup Complete

Your React app has been created in the `react-app` folder.

## Next Steps

1. Open the `react-app` folder in VS Code.
2. Run the development server:
   ```powershell
   cd react-app
   npm start
   ```
3. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view your app.

## Common Commands
- `npm start`: Start the development server
- `npm run build`: Build for production
- `npm test`: Run tests

## Notes
- You may see a notice about vulnerabilities. You can run `npm audit fix --force` to address them, but for basic development, this is optional.
- Create React App is deprecated, but still works for simple projects. For new projects, consider alternatives like Vite or Next.js.

Let me know if you want to customize your React app or need help with the next steps.
